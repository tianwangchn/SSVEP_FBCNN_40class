# SSVEP_FBCNN_40class

This project is for the 40-class SSVEP classification based on FBCNN

The dataset is available: https://github.com/hisunjiang/Benchmark-dataset-for-SSVEP  

requirment: 
  python >= 3.6  
  tensorflow >= 2.0.0  
  scipy >= 1.4.1  
  scikit-learn >= 0.22.2  
  numpy >= 1.16.4  

It is recommended to use a GPU to acquire the better performance
